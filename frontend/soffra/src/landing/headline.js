              Translated from the Italian, Soffra means to suffer. This is the visceral experience of a cyclist attempting to defy gravity by cycling uphill with nothing more than biology, physiology and momentum. The suffering is temporary, however, the experience and sense of accomplishment lives on in perpetuity.
